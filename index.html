           <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
           <p>My birthday is on January 16, 2015 and I was born in San Jose. I like to play video games or basketball whenever I have time. I have 4 brothers named, (in order) Mason, Marshall, Marcus, and Madden. My dad’s name is Jason and my mom’s name is Mona Lisa.
	 I wished I had a vacation with my whole family in Hawaii. And when I am there I would like to try to swim while sharks are swimming with me. We would all have a pool party. I would also like to go to space someday to meet aliens and lead them to my leader.

           <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
               <h3>Long term goals</h3>
                   <p>My long term goals is to just graduate in at least highschool. I plan to keep the
                   importance of my education in mind and to study hard in all my classes. I also plan to 
                   make friends along the way. Since I came from Sanger I do not know anybody from Fresno 
                   Unified except for my cousin. But he has shown me to some people and it think I am going 
                   to meet some interesting people.</p>
               <h3>Short term goals</h3>
                   <p>My short term goal currently is to get my grade up in Spanish I to at least a B. In order to do that I will need to study more and remember what the words actually mean. I also need to ask my teacher for help and pay attention to him. I can also try to do some of the work at home whenever I have the time.
I also want to be able to get a job at some place anywhere really. Right now I just feel like I am wasting time with all the free time I have not doing something productive.

                <h3>Educational</h3>
                    <p>My Educational accomplishments have been getting straight A’s in 8th grade for like 5 seconds. I also got an award for participation in the science fair. It was the happiest day of my life. But what I am most proud of is was when I was able to get an award for perfect attendance. That is when I decided to quit while I was on top and retire as a professional student.</p>
